# Shopper Marketing Spend Analysis and Forecast Evaluation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing shopper marketing data to evaluate the actual spend across various dimensions, including Products, Retailers, and Ad Campaigns. It involves comparing these actual values with forecasted data to identify discrepancies and insights.

## Features

- Consolidation of actual spend data from multiple sources
- Calculation of total spend values for Products, Retailers, and Ad Campaigns
- Comparison of actual spend versus forecasted values
- Flagging of significant over/underestimations

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Alteryx Designer**: Required for running and editing the workflows.
- **Data Sources**: Access to the datasets for actual and forecasted spends.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Open Alteryx Workflows
   - Navigate to the `/workflows/` directory.
   - Open the relevant Alteryx workflow files (`.yxmd`, `.yxzp`) in Alteryx Designer.

3. Data Configuration
   - Place the required datasets in the `/datasets/` directory.
   - Ensure all file paths and configurations are correctly set in the workflow.

## Usage

1. Run the Workflow
   - Open the workflow in Alteryx Designer and run it to process the data and generate outputs.

2. Review Outputs
   - The results, including flagged discrepancies and aggregated spend data, will be available in the output files or visual reports.
